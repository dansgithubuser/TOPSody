TOPSody 2.0055E3 is simply a patriotic-type song meant to make TOPS sound important in a musical way.

The peice evolved from a simple chord progression to a 4-part harmony hymn, to a band peice with a vague melody, into a piano peice with a noticeable melody, and finally back into a band peice, which was meant as it's final destination.

One idea to extend the effectiveness of the peice was to march in while playing a fanfare and then starting the peice. But this seemed kind of ridiculous because the march would be so short -- merely from a hallway to the stage -- and you don't usually see people march to their seats and play a song.

Another was to add a choir to the band peice, with lyrics and all. But time ran out and lyrics didn't form. There was also no way that the choir would've been big enough to be heard over the band unless the whole audience sang along. Although this was considered too, communicating the music to a whole audience had annoying logistics to take care of, and again time was short. Furthermore, the audience's musical skills were doubtful.

The peice itself starts out with the whole band playing through the chord progression once. The woodwinds take over for a variation, followed by the brass, and then the full band returns at the end.

Unfortunately, no references to pi or other irrational numbers were made.

It should be noted that on the premiere performance of the peice, the conductor was told to wear a rainbow-colored wig, and did.
