This piece was composed almost equally by Sir Yao of the Royal Regiment of Canada and Lord Eisner of Toronto. There was not enough time to reconcile the two's ideas perfectly, which explains the piece somewhat.

The main body of the piece was composed by Yao. The parts composed by Eisner are the chords at C, namely the "Russian chords", and the second part of C, which is a reference to Pi. The influence of both composers can be felt almost anywhere, however.

The march at D is the "TOPS march" and should be reproduced while students are hiking at Algonquin. The timpani should be sung with the syllable "bom", and the flute should be whistled.
